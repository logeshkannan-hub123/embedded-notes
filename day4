CPU-only know Addition
Basics:
RAM-Primary memory storage
secondary storage(hardware)->Non-volatile Memory
Clock->Heart beat of CPU
RAM-2 Types
                  S-RAM : FlipFlop(made of) Static
                  D-RAM: capacitors(made of) Dynamic
ARM:
             Cortex  A->Application
                  Cortex  R->Real time Application
                  Cortex  M->Microcontroller(Process only)

1.Static RAM is faster than Dynamic Ram
BUS -> used to communicate between CPU up Computer ( Median)
Pheripherals :-
                        GPIO => To communicate environment
                                   => These are sent by ‘System Bus’ (s bus)

AHB1=>180MHZ(Maximum)
it is two types

    AHB/APB2-> 90MHZ(Maximum)

2.AHB/APBI-> 45MHZ(Maximum)

GPIO
    1. Reading digital signals -> input
    2. Issuing Interupts
    3. Generating Triggers

    i. Genric Pin:Values consist of one or two voltage settings.(High or Low)
    ii. Behaviour can be programmed using software

Multiplexing- This pins used this method
Generic part- All the pins are connected to part

output mode:open drain stage 
Pull up resistor ->always use 0 or 1
Gate drain source(GDS)

Pull Push Configuration(Automatic)
Memory Maped : using memory to acess the I&O  
Making partion in memory with address

Serial Communication-> 8 bit data  transfer one bit at time 
parallel Communication -> 8 bit data transfer at the same time


  LSB -> Lest significant bit
  MSB -> Most Significant bit

  serial communication method:

      Synchronous -> data tranismited with clock
      Asynchronous -> 
  UART:
        It's serial Communication
        It is also Synchronous or AschronousReciver or Tranismited
        UART is a Full Duplex
    Duplex:
        Data can be tranismited and recived
    Simplex:
        Data can be tranismited only or recived only
    Half Duplex:
        Data can transimited in only one way at a time
    Full Duplex:
        Data can both(transimited or recived) way at a time
